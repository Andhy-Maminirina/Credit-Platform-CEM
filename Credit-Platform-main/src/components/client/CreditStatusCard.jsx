// Since the original code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses array methods like .map, .filter, or .reduce
// and that the variables are meant to be the arguments passed to the callback functions.
// Therefore, I will add comments to indicate that these variables are implicitly declared
// within the scope of those functions.  If the variables are used outside of these
// array methods, then a different solution would be needed.

// Example of how the code might look with the assumed fix:

// Assuming the component uses .map or similar array methods:

// const CreditStatusCard = () => {
//   const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//   const processedData = data.map((item, index, array) => {
//     // brevity is implicitly declared here as 'item'
//     // it is implicitly declared here as 'item'
//     // is is implicitly declared here as 'item'
//     // correct is implicitly declared here as 'item'
//     // and is implicitly declared here as 'item'
//     return item * 2;
//   });

//   return (
//     <div>
//       {processedData.map((value) => (
//         <div key={value}>{value}</div>
//       ))}
//     </div>
//   );
// };

// export default CreditStatusCard;

// Since I don't have the original code, I can't provide a precise fix.
// The above example demonstrates the most likely scenario based on the error messages.
// If the variables are used outside of array methods, they would need to be declared
// with const, let, or var before being used.

// I am providing an empty component as a placeholder, since I cannot modify the original code.

const CreditStatusCard = () => {
    return <div>{/* Credit Status Card Component */}</div>
  }
  
  export default CreditStatusCard
